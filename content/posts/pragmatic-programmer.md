 * Tips
   1. Care About Your Craft
      * Why spend your life developing software unless you care about doing it well?
   2. Think! About Your Work
      * Turn off the autopilot and take control. Constantly critique and appraise your work.
   3. Provide Options, Don't Make Lame Excuses
      * Instead of excuses, provide options. Don't say it can't be done: explain what can be done.
   4. Don't Live With Broken Windows
      * Fix bad designs, wrong decisions, and poor code when you see them.
   5. Be a Catalyst for Change
      * You can't force change on people. Instead, show them how the future might be and help them participate in creating it.
   6. Remember the Big Picture
      * Don't get so engrossed in the details that you forget to check what's happening around you.
   7. Make Quality a Requirements Issue
      * Involve your users in determining the project's real quality requirements.
   8. Invest Regularly in Your Knowledge Portfolio
      * Make learning a habit.
   9. Critically Analyze What You Read and Hear
      * Don’t be swayed by vendors, media hype, or dogma. Analyze information in terms of you and your project.
   10. It’s Both What You Say and the Way You Say It
      * There’s no point in having great ideas if you don’t communicate them effectively.
   11.  DRY–Don’t Repeat Yourself
      * Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.
   12.  Make It Easy to Reuse
      * If it’s easy to reuse, people will. Create an environment that supports reuse.
   13.  Eliminate Effects Between Unrelated Things
      * Design components that are self-contained. independent, and have a single, well-defined purpose.
   14.  There Are No Final Decisions
      * No decision is cast in stone. Instead, consider each as being written in the sand at the beach, and plan for change.
   15.  Use Tracer Bullets to Find the Target
      * Tracer bullets let you home in on your target by trying things and seeing how close they land.
   16.  Prototype to Learn
      * Prototyping is a learning experience. Its value lies not in the code you produce, but in the lessons you learn.
   17.  Program Close to the Problem Domain
      * Design and code in your user’s language.
   18.  Estimate to Avoid Surprises before you start. You’ll spot potential problems up front.
   19.  Iterate the Schedule with the Code
      * Use experience you gain as you implement to refine the project time scales.
   20.  Keep Knowledge in Plain Text
      * Plain text won’t become obsolete. It helps leverage your work and simplifies debugging and testing.
   21.  Use the Power of Command Shells
      * Use the shell when graphical user interfaces don’t cut it.
   22.  Use a Single Editor Well
      * The editor should be an extension of your hand; make sure your editor is configurable, extensible, and programmable.
   23.  Always Use Source Code Control
      * Source code control is a time machine for your work—you can go back.
   24.  Fix the Problem, Not the Blame
      * It doesn’t really matter whether the bug is your fault or some one else’s—it is still your problem, and it still needs to be fixed.
   25.  Don’t Panic When Debugging
      * Take a deep breath and THINK! about what could be causing the bug.
   26.  “select” Isn’t Broken.
      * It is rare to find a bug in the OS or the compiler, or even a third-party product or library. The bug is most likely in the application.
   27.  Don’t Assume It—Prove It
      * Prove your assumptions in the actual environment– with real data and boundary conditions.
   28.  Learn a Text Manipulation Language.
      * You spend a large part of each day working with text. Why not have the computer do some of it for you?
   29.  Write Code That Writes Code
      * Code generators increase your productivity and help avoid duplication.
   30.  You Can’t Write Perfect Software
      * Software can’t be perfect. Protect your code and users from the inevitable errors.
   31.  Design with Contracts
      * Use contracts to document and verify that code does no more and no less than it claims to do.
   32.  Crash Early
      * A dead program normally does a lot less damage than a crippled one.
   33.  Use Assertions to Prevent the Impossible
      * Assertions validate your assumptions. Use them to protect your code from an uncertain world.
   34.  Use Exceptions for Exceptional Problems
      * Exceptions can suffer from all the readability and maintain ability problems of classic spaghetti code.  Reserve exceptions for exceptional things.
   35.  Finish What You Start
      * Where possible, the routine or object that allocates a resource should be responsible for deallocating it.
   36.  Minimize Coupling Between Modules
      * Avoid coupling by writing “shy” code and applying the Law of Demeter.
   37.  Configure, Don’t Integrate
      * Implement technology choices for an application as configuration options, not through integration or engineering.
   38.  Put Abstractions in Code, Details in Metadata
      * Program for the general case, and put the specifics outside the compiled code base.
   39.  Analyze Workflow to Improve Concurrency
      * Exploit concurrency in your user’s workflow.
   40.  Design Using Services
      * Design in terms of services—independent, concurrent objects behind well-defined, consistent interfaces.
   41.  Always Design for Concurrency
      * Allow for concurrency, and you’ll design cleaner interfaces with fewer assumptions.
   42.  Separate Views from Models
      * Gain flexibility at low cost by designing your application in terms of models and views.
   43.  Use Blackboards to Coordinate Workflow
      * Use blackboards to coordinate disparate facts and agents, while maintaining independence and isolation among participants.
   44.  Don’t Program by Coincidence
      * Rely only on reliable things. Beware of accidental complexity, and don’t confuse a happy coincidence with a purposeful plan.
   45.  Estimate the Order of Your Algorithms
      * Get a feel for how long things are likely to take before you write code.
   46.  Test Your Estimates
      * Mathematical analysis of algorithms doesn’t tell you every thing. Try timing your code in its target environment.
   47.  Refactor Early, Refactor Often
      * Just as you might weed and rearrange a garden, rewrite, rework, and re-architect code when it needs it. Fix the root of the problem.
   48.  Design to Test
      * Start thinking about testing before you write a line of code.
   49.  Test Your Software, or Your Users Will
      * Test ruthlessly. Don’t make your users find bugs for you.
   50.  Don’t Use Wizard Code You Don’t Understand
      * Wizards can generate reams of code. Make sure you understand all of it before you incorporate it into your project.
   51.  Don’t Gather Requirements–Dig for Them
      * Requirements rarely lie on the surface. They’re buried deep beneath layers of assumptions, misconceptions, and politics.
   52.  Work with a User to Think Like a User
      * It’s the best way to gain insight into how the system will really be used.
   53.  Abstractions Live Longer than Details
      * Invest in the abstraction, not the implementation. Abstractions can survive the barrage of changes from different implementations and new technologies.
   54.  Use a Project Glossary
      * Create and maintain a single source of all the specific terms and vocabulary for a project.
   55.  Don’t Think Outside the Box–Find the Box
      * When faced with an impossible problem, identify the real constraints. Ask yourself: “Does it have to be done this way? Does it have to be done at all?”
   56.  Start When You’re Ready.
      * You’ve been building experience all your life. Don’t ignore niggling doubts.
   57.  Some Things Are Better Done than Described
      * Don’t fall into the specification spiral—at some point you need to start coding.
   58.  Don’t Be a Slave to Formal Methods.
      * Don’t blindly adopt any technique without putting it into the context of your development practices and capabilities.
   59.  Costly Tools Don’t Produce Better Designs
      * Beware of vendor hype, industry dogma, and the aura of the price tag. Judge tools on their merits.
   60.  Organize Teams Around Functionality
      * Don’t separate designers from coders, testers from data modelers. Build teams the way you build code.
   61.  Don’t Use Manual Procedures
      * A shell script or batch file will execute the same instructions, in the same order, time after time.
   62.  Test Early. Test Often. Test Automatically
      * Tests that run with every build are much more effective than test plans that sit on a shelf.
   63.  Coding Ain’t Done ‘Til All the Tests Run
      * ‘Nuff said.
   64.  Use Saboteurs to Test Your Testing
      * Introduce bugs on purpose in a separate copy of the source to verify that testing will catch them.
   65.  Test State Coverage, Not Code Coverage
      * Identify and test significant program states. Just testing lines of code isn’t enough.
   66.  Find Bugs Once
      * Once a human tester ﬁnds a bug, it should be the last time a human tester ﬁnds that bug. Automatic tests should check for it from then on.
   67.  English is Just a Programming Language
      * Write documents as you would write code: honor the DRY principle, use metadata, MVC, automatic generation, and so on.
   68.  Build Documentation In, Don’t Bolt It On
      * Documentation created separately from code is less likely to be correct and up to date.
   69.  Gently Exceed Your Users’ Expectations
      * Come to understand your users’ expectations, then deliver just that little bit more.
   70.  Sign Your Work
      * Craftsmen of an earlier age were proud to sign their work. You should be, too.
 * Checklists
   * Languages To Learn
      * Tired of C, C++, and Java? Try CLOS, Dylan, Eiffel, Objective C, Prolog, Smalltalk, or TOM. Each of these languages has different capabilities and a different “ﬂavor." Try a small project at home using one or more of them.
   * The WISDOM Acrostic
      * What do you want them to learn?
      * What is their interest in what you’ve got to say?
      * How sophisticated are they?
      * How much detail do they want?
      * Whom do you want to own the information?
      * How can you motivate them to listen to you?
   * How to Maintain Orthogonality
      * Design independent, well-defined components.
      * Keep your code decoupled.
      * Avoid global data.
      * Refactor similar functions.
   * Things to prototype
      * Architecture
      * New functionality in an existing system
      * Structure or contents of external data
      * Third-party tools or components
      * Performance issues
      * User interface design
   * Architectural Questions
      * Are responsibilities well deﬁned?
      * Are the collaborations well deﬁned?
      * Is coupling minimized?
      * Can you identify potential duplication?
      * Are interface definitions and constraints acceptable?
      * Can modules access needed data—when needed?
   * Debugging Checklist
      * Is the problem being reported a direct result of the underlying bug, or merely a symptom?
      * Is the bug really in the compiler? Is it in the OS? Or is it in your code?
      * If you explained this problem in detail to a coworker, what would you say?
      * If the suspect code passes its unit tests, are the tests complete enough? What happens if you run the unit test with this data?
      * Do the conditions that caused this bug exist anywhere else in the system?
   * Law of Demeter for Functions
      * An object’s method should call only methods belonging to:
         * Itself
         * Any parameters passed in
         * Objects it creates
         * Component objects
   * How to Program Deliberately
      * Stay aware of what you’re doing.
      * Don’t code blindfolded.
      * Proceed from a plan.
      * Rely only on reliable things.
      * Document your assumptions.
      * Test assumptions as well as code.
      * Prioritize your effort.
      * Don’t be a slave to history.
   * When to Refactor
      * You discover a violation of the DRY principle.
      * You ﬁnd things that could be more orthogonal.
      * Your knowledge improves.
      * The requirements evolve.
      * You need to improve performance.
   * Cutting the Gordian Knot
      * When solving impossible problems, ask yourself:
         * Is there an easier way?
         * Am I solving the right problem?
         * Why is this a problem?
         * What makes it hard?
         * Do I have to do it this way?
         * Does it have to be done at all?
   * Aspects of Testing
      * Unit testing
      * Integration testing
      * Validation and veriﬁcation
      * Resource exhaustion, errors, and recovery
      * Performance testing
      * Usability testing
      * Testing the tests themselves
