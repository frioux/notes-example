     * 1 Basil- monstruoso, the very large leaf type, sometimes called lettuce leaf basil
     * 1-Basil- one of the purple types, or small-leaf globe variety
     * 2 Parsley- flat leaf Italian (curly looks nice, but has almost no flavor)
     * 1 Thyme- a must for seafood and stews
     * 1 Sweet Marjoram- very similar to oregano, but much more intensely flavored, and easy to grow
